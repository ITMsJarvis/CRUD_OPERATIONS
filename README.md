# CRUD_OPERATIONS
Todo File - Illustrating CRUD Operations in HTTP


Welcome to the Todo File! This file serves as a comprehensive demonstration of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using HTTP. As I upload this file to GitHub, let me explain how it showcases the essential interactions between the frontend and backend components of a web application.

# Create
To create new todo items, we utilize HTTP POST requests. The frontend sends data, including the todo title and description, to the backend server. The server handles this request and securely stores the new todo item for future reference.

>The createTodo() function handles the creation of a new todo item. It sends an HTTP POST request to the server, including the title and description of the todo item. Upon successful creation, the server responds with a confirmation, and the getTodo() function is called to update the list of todos.

# Read
For reading existing todo items, we rely on HTTP GET requests. The frontend communicates with the backend to fetch todo information, allowing users to view their tasks in real-time.

>The getTodo() function fetches existing todo items from the server using an HTTP GET request. The server responds with a list of todos, which are then displayed to the user. The function updates the todo list by calling the makeTodoCard() function for each todo item.

# Update
When it comes to updating todo items, we employ the power of HTTP PUT or PATCH requests. Users can modify specific attributes of a todo item, such as the title or description, with ease and flexibility.

>The putTodo(id) function enables updating a specific todo item. It prompts the user to enter a new title and description for the todo. Upon submission, an HTTP PUT request is sent to the server, updating the corresponding todo item. The getTodo() function is called afterwards to refresh the todo list.

# Delete
To remove unwanted todo items, we leverage HTTP DELETE requests. The backend server handles these requests diligently, ensuring the designated todo item is effectively deleted from the system.

>The deleteTodo(id) function handles the deletion of a specific todo item. It sends an HTTP DELETE request to the server, specifying the ID of the todo item to be deleted. After successful deletion, the getTodo() function is called to update the todo list.

# HelperFunction

>The makeTodoCard() function creates a card for a single todo item. It takes the title, description, and ID as parameters and appends the card to the todo list. The card includes options for editing and deleting the todo item.

With the Todo File as our guide, we dive deep into the world of web development, gaining hands-on understanding of how the frontend and backend systems seamlessly communicate using HTTP. By studying and experimenting with this code, we become proficient in implementing CRUD operations and building robust web applications that empower users to manage their todo tasks effortlessly. Let's unlock the power of CRUD operations together!
