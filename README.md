Todo File - Illustrating CRUD Operations in HTTP


Welcome to the Todo File! This file serves as a comprehensive demonstration of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using HTTP. As I upload this file to GitHub, let me explain how it showcases the essential interactions between the frontend and backend components of a web application.

#Create
To create new todo items, we utilize HTTP POST requests. The frontend sends data, including the todo title and description, to the backend server. The server handles this request and securely stores the new todo item for future reference.

#Read
For reading existing todo items, we rely on HTTP GET requests. The frontend communicates with the backend to fetch todo information, allowing users to view their tasks in real-time.

#Update
When it comes to updating todo items, we employ the power of HTTP PUT or PATCH requests. Users can modify specific attributes of a todo item, such as the title or description, with ease and flexibility.

#Delete
To remove unwanted todo items, we leverage HTTP DELETE requests. The backend server handles these requests diligently, ensuring the designated todo item is effectively deleted from the system.

With the Todo File as our guide, we dive deep into the world of web development, gaining hands-on understanding of how the frontend and backend systems seamlessly communicate using HTTP. By studying and experimenting with this code, we become proficient in implementing CRUD operations and building robust web applications that empower users to manage their todo tasks effortlessly. Let's unlock the power of CRUD operations together!
